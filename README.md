## Inspiration

- VendorVortex was inspired by the desire to empower local vendors and create a strong community around their businesses.
- We recognized the challenges faced by small vendors in gaining visibility and competing with larger online platforms. 
- We wanted to provide a solution that would enable local vendors to showcase their products and services while building meaningful connections with their customers.

## What it does

- VendorVortex is a platform that allows local vendors to create their accounts, establish their online shops, and connect with customers in an engaging manner. 
- Vendors can create customized plans, such as discounts, to attract and retain customers. 
- Users can join vendor communities, access the benefits of these plans.

## How we built it

VendorVortex is built using MERN Stack, React for frontend, MongoDB for backend and NodeJS and ExpressJS for the database. We have used Bootstrap for UI Enhancements. We have done password encrption using BcryptJS and hosted the site using netlify.

## Challenges we ran into



## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud of our idea that can make sure that the local vendors can attract and retain customers using the technology and they can grow along with the online shopping platforms. 
- We will be able to integrate new features like interaction between vendors and users, new product or shop announcements from the user etc.

## What we learned

- We learnt how to manage complex schemas using MongoDB, how to secure routes and how to manage more than one type of the users in a MERN application.

## What's next for VendorVortex

- Moving forward, We aim to enhance the platform by introducing additional features such as advanced analytics for vendors, personalized recommendations for users, and seamless integration with social media platforms.
