## Description

- The project is designed to help local vendors grow their small businesses by providing them a platform to showcase their shops and communities and plans ðŸš€. 
- Customers can easily discover these shops, connect with their local community, explore current discount plans, and even share their experiences on that platform with rating of service of that shop âœ¨.

## Inspiration

- VendorVortex was inspired by the desire to empower local vendors and create a strong community around their businesses.
- We recognized the challenges faced by small vendors in gaining visibility and competing with larger online platforms. 
- We wanted to provide a solution that would enable local vendors to showcase their products and services while building meaningful connections with their customers by providing them plans and discounts.

## What it does

- VendorVortex is a platform that allows local vendors to create their accounts, establish their online shops, and connect with customers in an engaging manner. 
- Vendors can create customized plans, such as discounts, to attract and retain customers. 
- Vendors can modify the stages of the customer according to their purchases from their shops and then they may provide a good discount to those customers.
- Users can join vendor communities, access the benefits of these plans.
- Users can provide the review of the service of that shop with ratings that everyone can see ðŸ™ˆ.

## How we built it

VendorVortex is built using MERN Stack, React for frontend, NodeJS and ExpressJS for backend and  MongoDB for the database. We have used Bootstrap for UI Enhancements. We have done password encrption using BcryptJS and hosted the site using netlify. We have handled all the corner cases and have meaningful middlewares for secure authorization.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced issue in managing the react states, it was not working properly due to version issue, but then we solved that issue. Same case was with mongoose package.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud of our idea that can make sure that the local vendors can attract and retain customers using the technology and they can grow along with the online shopping platforms. 
- We will be able to integrate new features like interaction between vendors and users, new product or shop announcements from the user etc.
- I have seen many vendors are facing such issues of not getting customers, this can definitely help to such vendors. 

## What we learned

- We learnt how to manage complex schemas using MongoDB, aggregators and how to secure routes. And most importantly how to build such big server in very short time âž•.

## What's next for VendorVortex

- Moving forward, We aim to enhance the platform by introducing additional features such as advanced analytics for vendors and personalized recommendations for users.
